Learning computer programming will improve your problem-solving skills.

The best way to solve a problem involves:
1. Having a framework
2. Practicing it!

#### Have a Framework
When you encounter a problem, 
1. Make sure you understand it enough to explain it simply.
2. Think about the problem and plan your approach.
3. Break the problem into smaller sub-problems. Then connect your sub-solutions!
4. If you get stuck on a sub-problem, 
 - debug
 - reassess
 - research

Practice solving problems, and you'll get better at it. You could even get some practice with the little problems you'd find in chess or video games. The more problems you encounter, the closer you'll get to the best version of you!
