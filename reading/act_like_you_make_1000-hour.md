- Most people value their time at far, far less than it's worth.
- Imagine an hour of your time is worth $1000. What would you do differently?

#### Be disciplined enough not to be "busy".
The most productive people are not busy: they are focused.

#### Being "busy" is usually little more than a distraction and ego-trip
If you don't manage your time, it will manage you! Cultivate extreme focus with whatever you do, and you'll be more productive.

#### Your attitude about yourself shapes your experience and others' perceptions of you
People will recognize it and treat you differently if you treat yourself with respect.

#### Say "No" more often, and give yourself more time to be really successful
Choose your priorities carefully. And anything you can honestly justify doing for $1000/hour is probably a good thing!
