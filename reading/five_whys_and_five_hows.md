- If you ask "Why?" about a problem five times, you're drilling down into it.
- If you ask "How?" five times, you develop the details to a solution to a problem.
- The Five Whys can help push a team through brainstorming and diagramming cause and effect
- The Five Hows can help a team develop a solution-and-effect diagram to develop more details to a solution under consideration.
- Use this technique by clearly writing down the problem or solution to be explored on a chart. Write "Why?" five times and "How?" five times beneath it. Then, answer your Whys and Hows.
