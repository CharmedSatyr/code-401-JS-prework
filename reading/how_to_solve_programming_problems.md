### Notes on "How to Solve Programming Problems" by John Sonmez

#### Common problems people have when solving algorithms
1. Improper allocation of time. Be sure to think before you start writing code!
2. Trying to solve the  problem on the first iteration. Keep it simple!

#### Steps to follow when solving algorithms (1-3 should take as much as 70% of your time):
1. Read the problem completely twice. Make sure you totally understand it.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data. Figure out what parts you need to automate later on (being sure to consider corner cases).
3. Optimize the manual steps. See if you can solve the problem in a simpler way.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code. Determine the structure your code will have.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code. If you're struggling, return to step 3.
6. Optimize the real code. Make sure other people can understand what you did!

This type of approach should help you a lot in programming interviews, but the only way to build confidence in it is to practice.

And if the above steps don't work, divide your problem into smaller parts!
